# Schrodinger-religion

## Religion and github
An OpenSource religion created with the power GitHub. The concept is simple, building a community that will
contribute to the religion itself.

## The premise
I'm a young man, almost 30, and I have decided to share my thoughts about how a religion should be.
The recent problems caused by extremists of various religions made me think that we need something new.
We need as humanity a new way to see the world. (Spitz Park, 8.6.2016)

The start, here I begin, here I decided to throw the basis of a **plastic and dynamic** religion.
