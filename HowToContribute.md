# How to contribute

Github offers the possibility to create a copy of the project and working on that.

Technically would be like that you take my view of the Schrodinger religion, copy it, and make your own religion out of it.
If we both agree on the changes, then we can merge the two and unify it. Else they will live as separate entities.

# How to create my religion?

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. Fork the repository (the repository is the text of the religion)
3. Make your changes, bring contents and add or delete elements.
4. Once you finished propose a pull request on my [repository](https://github.com/Pella86/Schrodinger-religion)
  - It will maybe be accepted or spawn a discussion.
5. I update the master of my religion with your changes.
6. If I won't accept your changes, don't worry your Schrodinger religion will live as a separate entitiy.
