# Reality

It's a philosophical problem that has an impact on many of the topics that will touched upon here.

#### Summary in one line
"Reality manifests as the collective, human, experiential world in a lawful, stable, and consistent manner that, as our knowledge advances, is increasingly predictable, is independent of any individual's wishes and biases, and outlasts our deaths or lapses in consciousness." [1]
For now I'll take the Yoism view of reality which is in accordance with Bohr's quantistic view of the world and in discord with Einstein's  realism.

Is reality what we perceive or does a fundamental true reality exist?
