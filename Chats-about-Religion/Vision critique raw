I'm a young man, almost 30. I decided to share my thoughts about how a religion should be. The recent problems caused by extremists of various religions made me thought that we need something new. We need as humanity a new way to see the world. (Spitz Park, 8.6.2016)

This religion is meant to be a way of achieving coexistence in the human species and to promote progress. We will later define what is meant by progress and coexistence in more detail, but both terms should be taken in the literal form. Progress[2]: Development towards an improved or more advanced condition. Coexistence[3]: he state or condition of living in harmony despite different ideologies or interests.

Do you fear to go outside because you know of the existence of storms? Do you fear to drive your car because you know the probability of death is high?

Yes

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:51]
[In reply to Vision]
So you have no place lecturing people over your fears. You fear Pella might change the world with his view because of the butterfly effect but you also fear going outside. Control you fear, learn to see what is worth being feared and what is not

Vision, [28.10.16 21:52]
Wouldnt you try to stop a stupid actions before it could become big if you could

Pella Jiriya, [28.10.16 21:52]
He say it's a stupid concept, because it might actually work! with a butterfly effect, and people will follow it.

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:52]

I concur. He seems to think it may change alot of peoples view on life

Your distorted view on how things "should be done" is not something we measure peoples intelligence by. You claim followers of this belief undeniably have a lower IQ than others. Elaborate

Then what are test dummies for

Its not about iq
