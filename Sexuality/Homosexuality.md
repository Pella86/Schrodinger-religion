#Homosexuality

##Gender dynamism
I think we need to really start to listen to the Tumblr girls.
Sexual orientation and gender can be dynamic.

##Occourrence of homosexuality in other kingdom
Homosexual behavior exist in nature because it brings an advantage to the population. (source missing)
Could be both learned or genetic. There are yet to be genetically analysis that demonstrate the genetic linkage.
Other animals have homosexual behavior, we lack records from the past below the 70ies because biologist,
being humans, ignored such behaviors.
Lions use it for dominance assessing (same as the Roman empire), penguins being semelpair (like most of the birds)
engage homosexual behavior life long.

##Personal choice or predisposition
Homosexuality isn't a choice, like isn't a choice to be hetero. The sexual attraction, albeit can be guided, cannot be completely replaced. I would call it a predisposition. 
Sexual orientation and sexual preference come both from our conscious and subconscious thoughts.
There are gay reformatory, were people try to impose the heterosexuality. I have no idea about the success rate,
but I would say is very low.

##Minoritarian behavior
One last thing, being gay will always be controversial in a population, since will always be an alternative behavior of the standard.

##Practical considerations
Is homosexuality harming today society? Is homosexual propaganda harming more? Should the society control sexual behavior of its members?
If yes how?

##Sigmund Freud's basic theory of human sexuality 
Sigmund Freud's basic theory of human sexuality was different from that of Ellis. He believed all human beings were innately bisexual, and that they become heterosexual or homosexual as a result of their experiences with parents and others (Freud, 1905). Nevertheless, Freud agreed with Ellis that a homosexual orientation should not be viewed as a form of pathology. In a now-famous letter to an American mother in 1935, Freud wrote:
"Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc.). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime, and cruelty too...."
